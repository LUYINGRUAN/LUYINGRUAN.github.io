        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hi-Res Headphone Design:</strong> Generalized general equation for different mass density diaphragm situation, and used equation to successfullytest optimization assumption of diaphragm design of electrostatic headphones.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Communication Online Workshop:</strong>Simulated basic process of modulation/demodulation using MATLAB to compare and analyze Bit Error Ratioindifferent sub-band system.</li>
            <li><strong>IntelligentHospital Service System basedon End-cloud Collaborative Processing:</strong> Designed and established circuit system structure adopting sensors, data receiving end, display to collectivelysimulate the environment of hospital service system.Defined a signal transfer route based on ZigBee to make establish a reliable transfer media, which ensurestransmission without interruption in the hospital environments. Transferred data of STM32 core board to Raspberry Pi, which allows effective data processing andtransmissionbetween local devices and the cloud to enhance the overall service quality.</li>
